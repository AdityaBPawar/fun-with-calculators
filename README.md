Fun With Calculators

Welcome to Fun With Calculators, a personal project where I explore programming by building a variety of calculators. The idea is simple: start with the most basic calculators and gradually build more advanced ones, learning new programming concepts and languages along the way.

This project demonstrates my curiosity, coding growth, and ability to implement real-world functionality in Python (and potentially other languages in the future).

ðŸ§© Project Goal

The goal of this repo is to:
	1.	Learn by building: Understand core programming concepts through hands-on projects.
	2.	Experiment with languages: Implement similar calculators in different languages to compare syntax and features.
	3.	Show progression: Start from simple arithmetic calculators and gradually move to scientific, advanced, and expression-evaluating calculators.
	4.	Build portfolio projects: Showcase projects that demonstrate problem-solving and programming skills.

ðŸ›  Builds (so far...)

1) Most Basic Calculator (Python)
	â€¢	Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
	â€¢	Simple CLI interface
	â€¢	Really as barebones as a calculator can get

2) Scientific Calculator (Python)
	â€¢	Supports slightly advanced mathematical operations like trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in degrees, square root, logarithms (log, ln), power, absolute, rounding functions
  â€¢ It can evaluate full expressions like say: 2 + 3 * sin(30) - sqrt(16) + log(100)
  â€¢ Looping input allows multiple calculations without restarting
